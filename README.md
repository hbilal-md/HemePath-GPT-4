# HemePath-GPT-4

## Project Overview
HemePath GPT-4 is an advanced tool designed to leverage the OpenAI GPT-4 model for generating differential diagnoses in the field of hematopathology. It inputs patient-specific bone marrow differentials and peripheral blood CBC (Complete Blood Count) data, processing this information to provide expert-level diagnostic suggestions, immunohistochemical (IHC) stain recommendations, FLOW cytometry suggestions and diagnostic justifications.

## Features
- **Automated Differential Diagnosis**: Generates a ranked list of potential hematological diagnoses.
- **Suggests Logical Next Steps in Diagnosiss**: Suggests specific immunohistochemical stains and FLOW cytometry studies to investigate the diagnosis.
- **Diagnostic Justification**: Provides a concise justification for the recommended diagnosis, aiding in clinical decision-making.
